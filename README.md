### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practise the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) in java:

- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

###What I Learned
I didn't get to practise inheritance or polymorphism, but I still practised the following java fundamentals:
- Classes
- Methods
- User input
- Do-while and For loops
- Arrays
- Switch and If-else statements
